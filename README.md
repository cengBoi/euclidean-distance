# Euclidean Distance Calculator

This Python script calculates the minimum Euclidean distance between a set of randomly generated points.

## Functionality

The script generates 5 random points within a 20x20 square. It then calculates the Euclidean distance between each pair of points and determines the minimum distance.

## Usage

The script is self-contained and can be run directly using a Python interpreter. The output displays the generated points and the minimum distance found.

## Example Output

```
Points:
(12.34, 5.67)
(8.90, 15.23)
(1.23, 9.87)
(18.76, 2.34)
(5.43, 11.90)
Minimum distance between points:  3.65
```

(Note: Output will vary due to random point generation)

## Code Overview

The core logic is implemented in the `euclideanDistance` function, which iterates through all pairs of points and calculates the distance using the standard Euclidean distance formula.
